        <h1 id="Why-Clifford’s-Suns-Stole-the-Show"><a href="#Why-Clifford’s-Suns-Stole-the-Show" class="headerlink" title="Why Clifford’s Suns Stole the Show"></a>Why Clifford’s Suns Stole the Show</h1><p>Clifford’s Suns stole the show in the 2017 Utah Jazz season. While the team as a whole had a great season, and many players had standout moments, it was the Suns who truly shined.</p>
<p>Alec Burks was one of the main contributors for the Suns. He averaged 17 points per game and shot over 43% from beyond the arc. He was also able to get to the free throw line frequently and shot over 81% from the stripe. His play earned him a four-year, $42 million extension from the Jazz.</p>
<p>Rudy Gobert also played a major role for Clifford’s Suns. He averaged 14 points, 12 rebounds, and 2.6 blocks per game. He was also named to his first All-Star team and finished third in voting for Defensive Player of the Year.</p>
<p>Donovan Mitchell was another key player for Clifford’s Suns. He averaged 20 points, 3 rebounds, and 3 assists per game while shooting 38% from three-point range. He was also named Rookie of the Year and made the All-Rookie Team.</p>
<p>Despite all of their individual success, Clifford’s Suns were unable to make it past the first round of the playoffs. However, they provided plenty of excitement throughout the year and looked poised to make a deep playoff run in future seasons.</p>
<h1 id="Chris-Paul-Leads-Clippers-to-Victory-Over-Suns-in-Second-Half"><a href="#Chris-Paul-Leads-Clippers-to-Victory-Over-Suns-in-Second-Half" class="headerlink" title="Chris Paul Leads Clippers to Victory Over Suns in Second Half"></a>Chris Paul Leads Clippers to Victory Over Suns in Second Half</h1><p>The Clippers pulled out a victory against the Suns Wednesday night, thanks in large part to Chris Paul. He led the team to a comeback after they were down by as many as 15 points in the second half.</p>
<p>Paul finished with 28 points and 10 assists. He was 8 for 12 from the field, including 5 for 7 from three-point range.</p>
<p>Blake Griffin added 24 points and 11 rebounds for the Clippers. Jared Dudley came off the bench to score 19 points, including four three-pointers.</p>
<p> Goran Dragic led the Suns with 21 points and eight assists. Channing Frye added 18 points and six rebounds off the bench.</p>
<h1 id="Suns-Steal-a-Win-from-the-Clippers-Late-in-the-Game"><a href="#Suns-Steal-a-Win-from-the-Clippers-Late-in-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Suns Steal a Win from the Clippers Late in the Game"></a>Suns Steal a Win from the Clippers Late in the Game</h1><p>The Phoenix Suns entered Staples Center to take on the LA Clippers in a game that would see the Suns steal a victory late in the game. The Suns were led by Devin Booker, who scored 38 points and TJ Warren, who added 21 points.</p>
<p>DeAndre Jordan led the Clippers with 20 points and 17 rebounds while Lou Williams added 22 points off the bench.</p>
<p>The first quarter was tightly contested with both teams exchanging baskets. The Suns led 30-28 at the end of the quarter. The second quarter was more of the same with both teams scoring 33 points, but it was the Clippers who took a 61-57 lead into halftime.</p>
<p>The third quarter was more of the same with both teams scoring 27 points, but it was the Suns who outscored the Clippers 34-29 in the fourth quarter to steal a win 103-100.</p>
<h1 id="138-122-Clippers-top-Suns-for-fourth-consecutive-victory"><a href="#138-122-Clippers-top-Suns-for-fourth-consecutive-victory" class="headerlink" title="138-122: Clippers top Suns for fourth consecutive victory"></a>138-122: Clippers top Suns for fourth consecutive victory</h1><p>LOS ANGELES, CA - The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Phoenix Suns 138-122 for their fourth consecutive victory. </p>
<p>The Clippers were led by Lou Williams, who scored 37 points on 14-of-21 shooting. Danilo Gallinari added 27 points, eight rebounds and six assists, and Tobias Harris had 25 points and 10 rebounds. </p>
<p>Phoenix was led by Devin Booker, who scored 41 points on 13-of-27 shooting. Deandre Ayton added 18 points and 10 rebounds, and TJ Warren had 16 points. </p>
<p>The Clippers have now won four in a row and six of their last seven games. The Suns have lost four in a row and six of their last seven games.</p>
<h1 id="Another-Solid-Performance-from-the-LA-Clippers"><a href="#Another-Solid-Performance-from-the-LA-Clippers" class="headerlink" title="Another Solid Performance from the LA Clippers"></a>Another Solid Performance from the LA Clippers</h1><p>In the NBA, there are teams that always manage to surprise people no matter how well you think you know them. The LA Clippers are one of those teams and after their latest victory against the Golden State Warriors, it’s evident that they aren’t going to go down without a fight.</p>
<p>This season, we’ve seen the Clippers put up some unbelievable displays of basketball. They don’t seem to be phased by who they’re playing against and continue to give their all every night.</p>
<p>This was particularly evident against the Warriors on Saturday night. Down by 14 points in the first half, they came back with a vengeance in the second half and managed to take the lead. The final score was 123-119 in favor of the Clippers which just goes to show how much determination they have this season.</p>
<p>Golden State is no slouch though and they put up a good fight too. Klay Thompson led all scorers with 32 points while Steph Curry added 23 points of his own. However, it wasn’t enough to stop Lou Williams from scoring 36 points on the night.</p>
<p>With this victory, the Clippers improve their record to 28-23 on the season which is currently good for 5th place in the Western Conference standings. If they can keep this up, they definitely have a chance of making it deep into the playoffs this year.</p>
