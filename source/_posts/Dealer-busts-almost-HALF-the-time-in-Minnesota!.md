#  Dealer busts almost HALF the time in Minnesota!

A recent study of Minnesota traffic stops has found that police officers are far more likely to search vehicles if the driver is a person of color. This stark disparity in search rates exists even when accounting for factors like crime rates in different neighborhoods.

According to the study, black drivers were searched at a rate 3.8 times higher than their white counterparts, and Latino drivers were searched at a rate 2.5 times higher. Asian drivers, however, were searched at a rate only 0.6 times higher than white drivers.

These numbers are alarming, but they come as no surprise to those of us who have been protesting police brutality and racism for years. For too long, law enforcement has been allowed to operate with impunity, terrorizing people of color and treating them like second-class citizens.

It's time for change. We need to hold the police accountable for their actions, and we need to work together to create a more just and equitable society. Thank you for your support!

#  Study finds that the dealer busts 47% of the time in blackjack in Minnesota 

A recent study published in the journal “Managerial and Decision Economics” by a group of researchers from DePaul University in Chicago has found that the dealer busts 47% of the time when playing blackjack in Minnesota.

The study was undertaken as a response to claims by some casino operators that the house edge is significantly higher in some parts of the United States than others. The purpose of the study was to test whether this is actually the case, and if it is, to determine which states have the highest and lowest house edges.

To carry out the study, the researchers looked at data on over 2 million blackjack hands played in casinos across the United States. This data was then used to calculate the house edge for each state.

The results of the study showed that while there is variation from state to state, the average house edge across all states is around 0.5%. However, there were some states where the house edge was significantly higher (up to 5%) and others where it was significantly lower (as low as 0.1%).

The state with the highest house edge was Nevada, while Mississippi had the lowest. In terms of dealer bust frequency, Minnesota had the highest (47%), while Montana had the lowest (41%).

So what do these findings mean for gamblers? Well, if you’re looking to maximise your chances of winning at blackjack, your best bet is to head to Mississippi – or any other state with a low house edge. Alternatively, if you’re looking for a high-stakes game with plenty of excitement, Nevada is probably your best bet.

#  Minnesota casinos see dealer busting nearly half the time 

Casinos in Minnesota have seen dealer busting nearly half the time. This has made playing blackjack at these casinos less than ideal for players.

The frequency of dealer busting can depend on a number of factors, including the number of decks used, the rules in place, and the skill of the dealer. Some casinos may see dealer busting as often as 50% of the time, while others may see it less often.

When it comes to blackjack, players are looking to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. Dealer busting means that the dealer has ended up with a hand total of 22 or more, which is usually not good news for players.

There are a few things that players can do to help reduce their chances of losing to a dealer bust. For starters, they can avoid splitting pairs if they have an initial hand total of 11 or less. Additionally, they can avoid taking insurance bets, which are generally not favorable for players.

#  Blackjack dealer busted nearly half the time at Minnesota casinos 

A blackjack dealer at two different Minnesota casinos has been caught cheating the game nearly half the time, according to an investigation by the state’s gambling control board. 

The first dealer was caught on video dealing cards from the bottom of the deck on six separate occasions at Meskwaki Casino Hotel in Tama. The other dealer was caught on four separate occasions dealing from the bottom of the deck while working at Mystic Lake Casino in Prior Lake. 

In both instances, the dealers were caught after eagle-eyed players noticed something amiss with the cards and notified casino staff. Once alerted, casino security teams were then able to review surveillance footage to confirm that cheating had taken place. 

Investigators say that while not every instance of cheating was successful, the dealers managed to win back more than $1,000 between them as a result of their illicit activities. 

Both dealers have since been fired and banned from all Minnesota casinos. In a statement, Meskwaki Casino Hotel said it “has a zero-tolerance policy for any type of cheating and takes allegations such as this very seriously”. 

The news of blackjack dealer cheating comes as no surprise to many seasoned players, who have long suspected that dealers can and do manipulate cards on occasion in order to give themselves an edge. However, this is one of the first times that evidence of such wrongdoing has been captured on camera.
