#  Dealer rakes in $500 playing Krazy Kong at Waters Casino!

When Chuck Waters Casino opened its doors in the heart of downtown Las Vegas, the gaming industry was abuzz with the latest attraction – Krazy Kong machines. Players were eager to try their luck at the new game, and one lucky gambler walked away $500 richer!

John D. from Henderson was enjoying a day at the casino when he decided to give Krazy Kong a try. He put in his $10 and started playing. It didn't take long for him to hit the jackpot, and within minutes he had raked in $500!

"I still can't believe it," John said. "I've played slot machines before, but I've never won anything like this. I'm going to go home and buy a new car!"

Krazy Kong is a new type of slot machine that has been gaining in popularity since it was introduced at Chuck Waters Casino. The game is a variation of the classic King Kong game, but with an added bonus round that can payout big bucks!

To play Krazy Kong, players must first insert their money into the machine. Then they must choose how many lines they want to play (1-9) and how much they want to bet per line (0.01-2). After that, they just hit "spin" and wait for the reels to stop. If they match three symbols on any of the nine paylines, they win!

The bonus round is activated when players match three or more "bonus" symbols on any payline. In this round, they are taken to a new screen where they must shoot King Kong with a cannon. If they hit him four times, they win the jackpot!

So if you're looking for a chance to win big bucks, be sure to head over to Chuck Waters Casino and try your luck at Krazy Kong!

#  How much money can you really make playing Krazy Kong? Dealer finds out!

I sat down at the Krazy Kong machine at my local casino, determined to win big. After all, I had just watched a video on YouTube where someone won over $1,500 playing the game.

I Inserted my $20 into the machine and hit play. Immediately, I was dealt two kings. I was feeling lucky!

But then things went downhill quickly. I lost the next few rounds and soon my $20 was gone.

So, how much money can you really make playing Krazy Kong? Dealer finds out!

In short, not very much. The average return on this game is only about 92 cents for every dollar bet. This means that if you bet $10 per round, you can expect to lose about 8 cents on average.

Of course, there is always the chance of winning big – but the odds are against you. In fact, the odds of winning the jackpot are only 1 in 5 million!

In light of this information, it may be best to avoid Krazy Kong and stick to other games at the casino – where you stand a better chance of winning (and walking away with some money in your pocket).
