#  Delaware Sees Huge Gains in Hosting Online Gambling Sites 

Delaware has seen a surge in revenue from hosting online gambling sites in the past year, with the state taking in over $9 million in taxes from the operators. Delaware was one of the first states to legalize online gambling, and it seems to be paying off, as the industry is now worth over $300 million.

This is great news for Delaware, which is facing budget deficits due to falling oil prices. Gambling revenues have been steadily rising in the state, and are now a crucial part of its budget.

The future looks bright for online gambling in Delaware, as more and more people are becoming comfortable with betting their money online. With its huge tax revenue, Delaware is proving that online gambling can be a major boon to state coffers.

#  Nevada Seeing Increased Revenue from Online Gambling Sites  

According to a report from the Nevada Gaming Control Board, the state has seen a significant uptick in revenue from online gambling sites in recent years. The board reported that Nevada took in almost $9.5 million from internet gambling sites in 2016, up from $5 million in 2015 and just over $3 million in 2014.

Nevada legalized online gambling in 2013, and the industry has been growing steadily since then. While other states have also legalized online gambling, Nevada's market is the largest by far, with more than two-thirds of all U.S. online gambling revenue coming from Nevada sites.

The rise in online gambling revenue is due in part to the increasing popularity of mobile gaming. More people are using their smartphones and tablets to gamble, and casinos are offering more and more games that can be played on mobile devices.

The rise of online gaming has also led to a decline in casino visitation rates in Nevada. Casino revenues have been falling for years, but internet gambling is helping to offset some of those losses.

Some experts believe that the growth of online gambling will eventually lead to the demise of traditional casinos. However, others believe that the two industries can coexist peacefully, with each serving different segments of the market.

Whatever happens, it's clear that online gambling is here to stay. And as long as Nevada continues to offer a safe and secure environment for players, its share of the global online gaming market is likely to continue to grow.

#  Atlantic City casino revenues continue to decline, but online gambling may pick up the slack 

Atlantic City's casino revenues continue to decline in the face of increasing competition from casinos in neighboring states. The total amount wagered at the city's casinos was down 2.5% in the second quarter of 2017, and casino revenue was down 4%. 

However, there is some good news for the city's gambling industry: online gambling continues to grow rapidly. In the second quarter of 2017, online gambling revenue was up 27%. This growth is being driven by increased use of mobile devices for gambling, as well as the legalization of online gambling in a number of states. 

It is likely that online gambling will pick up some of the slack created by the decline in Atlantic City's casino revenue. However, it is also likely that the overall decline in casino revenue will continue in the coming years.

#  Pennsylvania Prepares to Launch Online Gambling Site in Early 2018 
Pennsylvania is preparing to launch its first online gambling site in early 2018. The new site will allow residents of the state to gamble on games of chance such as blackjack, poker, and slots.

The online gambling site will be operated by the Pennsylvania Lottery, which is already well-known for its popular lottery games. The new site is expected to generate significant revenue for the state government, which is currently facing a budget crisis.

In order to access the online gambling site, players must be at least 21 years of age and reside in Pennsylvania. They will also need to have a valid account with the Pennsylvania Lottery.

Residents of other states are not allowed to participate in Pennsylvania's online gambling site. This is because online gambling is illegal in most other states.

Pennsylvania's new online gambling site is part of a growing trend nationwide. A number of states have launched or are planning to launch their own online gambling sites in order to raise revenue.

Some lawmakers in Pennsylvania are opposed to the new site, arguing that it could lead to addiction and social problems. However, supporters argue that the site will be tightly regulated and will provide a safe and fun way for residents to gamble responsibly.

#  Could Rhode Island Be the Next State to Host an Online Gambling Site?

Rhode Island is considering legalizing and regulating online gambling, which would make it the fourth state in the U.S. to do so.

The bill, introduced by Democratic Representative Dennis Canario, would allow people over the age of 21 to gamble on approved websites from their home computers or mobile devices. The state would generate revenue from licensing fees and taxes on gambling profits.

The legislation is motivated by a desire to help the state's struggling casinos, which have been hurt by competition from neighboring states with casino gambling. Rhode Island currently has two legal casino resorts, Twin River in Lincoln and Foxwoods in Mashantucket, CT.

Earlier this year, a study commissioned by the Rhode Island General Assembly found that online gambling could generate up to $23 million annually in new revenue for the state. This could help offset some of the $220 million budget shortfall projected for the next fiscal year.

Supporters of online gambling say that it is a safe and convenient way to gamble, and that it would create jobs and boost tourism. They argue that it would be better for Rhode Islanders to gamble on approved websites than to drive to casinos in other states.

Opponents of online gambling argue that it is addictive and can lead to financial disaster for vulnerable people. They also claim that it would be difficult to enforce age restrictions and stop people from gambling illegally.
