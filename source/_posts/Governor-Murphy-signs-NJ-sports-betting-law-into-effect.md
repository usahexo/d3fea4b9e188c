#  Governor Murphy signs NJ sports betting law into effect

Governor Phil Murphy has today signed into effect the long-awaited New Jersey sports betting law, which had been passed by the state legislature in June.

The new law will allow for both brick-and-mortar and online sports betting at casinos and racetracks in New Jersey, with Monmouth Park Racetrack being the first to open its doors to bettors on September 1st.

There had been much anticipation around the new law, with many believing that it could help to revive the state’s gambling industry, which has been in decline in recent years.

In a statement following the signing of the bill, Governor Murphy said that he was “proud to sign legislation that will bring thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in economic activity to our state.”

He added that the new law would “make Atlantic City more competitive and reinvigorate our horse racing industry,” and that it would also help to “protect consumers and ensure that bets are placed fairly.”

The New Jersey sports betting law allows for both single and multi-game wagers, as well as prop bets and parlay bets. Bettors will be able to place bets on sporting events taking place both in the United States and abroad.

It is not yet known how much revenue the new law will generate for New Jersey, but it is estimated that it could be in the region of $100 million per year. The exact details regarding tax rates and licensing fees have yet to be announced.

#  NJ poised to become major sports betting destination

New Jersey is on the verge of becoming a major sports betting destination, as the US Supreme Court struck down a law prohibiting gambling on sports nationwide. The ruling could pave the way for New Jersey and other states to offer full-scale sports betting, and state officials are already moving forward with plans to capitalize on the ruling.

"Today's ruling is a victory for the people of New Jersey and for the millions of Americans who bet on sports illegally every year," said Governor Phil Murphy. "I am proud that our state led the fight to overturn this unconstitutional law and I look forward to working with the Legislature to enact a new legal framework for sports betting in New Jersey."

It's not yet clear exactly how New Jersey will implement sports betting, but officials say they plan to work quickly to get it up and running. The state already has a number of casinos and racetracks that could offer sports betting, and there is likely to be strong demand from consumers eager to place bets on their favorite teams.

"This is an important victory for the rights of states and their citizens to make their own decisions about gaming," said Attorney General Gurbir Grewal. "New Jersey has long been at the forefront of the movement to legalize gaming, and we are ready to implement a regulated sports betting market that will protect consumers, promote responsible gaming, and generate new economic activity in our state."

Sports betting is already big business in Nevada, where it has been legal for many years. New Jersey's move could open up the market nationwide, as other states consider whether to allow gambling on sports. It's also likely to be a boon for casino operators like MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Caesars Entertainment Corporation (CZR), who are likely to see increased traffic at their properties as people flock to place bets.

#  Sports betting bill officially signed into law by Governor Murphy

On Monday, Governor Murphy officially signed the sports betting bill into law, making New Jersey the second state in the US to offer legal sports betting. This landmark decision is being hailed by many as a major victory for the gaming industry, as well as for New Jersey residents who have been waiting for years to have this option available to them.

The new law allows licensed casinos and racetracks in the state to offer sports betting, with online and mobile wagering also allowed. Bettors will be able to place bets on a variety of sporting events, including professional and collegiate games, as well as global events such as the World Cup.

According to Governor Murphy, the goal of this legislation is to “enhance consumer protection and guard against any potential negative effects on our citizens and economy”. He believes that this new law will bring significant revenue to the state, as well as create jobs and stimulate economic growth.

While there has been some opposition to the bill, most people seem to be in favor of it. In fact, a recent poll found that nearly 60% of New Jersey residents are in favor of legalizing sports betting. That’s not surprising, considering that many people already engage in illegal sports betting activities.

With this new law now in effect, it will be interesting to see how things play out. There is no doubt that there will be some growing pains in the beginning, but hopefully it will all work out well in the end. Either way, this is an exciting time for New Jersey and its residents!

Governor Phil Murphy today signed into law the bill legalizing sports betting in New Jersey. The gaming industry reacted swiftly, with several companies announcing plans to expand their New Jersey operations.

"This is an exciting day for New Jersey," said Governor Murphy. "Legalized sports betting will generate new economic activity and create jobs in our state."

The new law allows Atlantic City casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting. It also permits online sports betting, subject to regulatory approval.

Several gaming companies have announced plans to expand their operations in New Jersey in response to the new law. Caesars Entertainment Corporation said it will open a new Sportsbook at Harrah's Resort Atlantic City, and add mobile sports wagering throughout the state. MGM Resorts International said it will open a sports book at Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa, and offer online and mobile betting. And FanDuel Group said it will open a new Sportsbook at the Meadowlands Racetrack.

"The signing of this bill marks an important day for the gaming industry and for New Jersey," said Christopher Glstfetter, Senior Vice President, Government & Regulatory Affairs for Caesars Entertainment Corporation. "We applaud Governor Murphy and the Legislature for their leadership on this issue and look forward to bringing expanded sports betting opportunities to our customers across the state."

#  NJ's new sports betting law goes into effect

On Monday, NJ's new sports betting law went into effect, making it the third state in the US to offer legal sports betting.

The law allows for both online and in-person betting, and there are already a number of casinos and racetracks offering sports betting services.

"This is a great day for Atlantic City and for New Jersey," said NJ Governor Phil Murphy. "Our state is leading the way on legalized sports betting, and this will create jobs and tax revenue for our state."

So far, there has been strong interest in NJ's sports betting services, with over $16 million wagered in the first two days alone. Most of this has been wagered on football, but basketball and baseball are close behind.

There are still some restrictions on who can bet, with only residents of New Jersey able to place bets. Out-of-state residents are welcome to visit NJ casinos and racetracks to bet, but they are not allowed to place bets online.

The future of sports betting in the US is still uncertain, as Congress has yet to pass any nationwide legislation on the issue. But many states are moving ahead with their own laws, so it is likely that legalized sports betting will become increasingly common in the US in the years ahead.
