#  Precisely How to Play Blackjack and Poker Like the French

In France, they play blackjack and poker the right way. They adhere to the rules and know when to hold `em and when to fold `em. But, even if you're not French, you can still enjoy playing blackjack and poker - and do it like the French by following these simple instructions.

First, let's talk about blackjack. The basic idea behind blackjack is to get as close as possible to 21 without going over. The player is dealt two cards, and the dealer has one card face up and one card face down. The player can choose to hit (take another card) or stand (end the turn). If the player goes over 21, they bust and lose the hand. The goal is to beat the dealer's hand - either by getting a higher total than the dealer, or by having the dealer bust.

When playing blackjack, there are a few basic things to keep in mind:

- Always hit on 16 or less, and stand on 17 or more. This is called Basic Strategy, and it's the most mathematically correct way to play blackjack.

- Doubling down is a good way to increase your chances of winning when you have a good hand. This involves doubling your bet after being dealt your first two cards, and then receiving just one more card.

- A split is when you split your cards into two separate hands. For example, if you're dealt an 8 and a 2, you can split them into two hands (8/8 and 2/2) and play each hand separately. You can also double down on splits.

Now let's move on to poker. Poker is a game of strategy, chance, and skill - which makes it both challenging and fun! The goal of poker is to win all of the chips in the pot by forming the best possible five-card hand out of seven cards (two hole cards plus five community cards). There are many different types of poker games, but all of them follow basically the same rules: players are each dealt two hole cards; five community cards are placed in the middle of the table; players use their hole cards plus any three of the community cards to form their best five-card hand; bets are placed before any cards are turned over; Showdown occurs when only two players remain in contention for the pot; highest ranking five-card hand takes home the prize money.

There are three main betting rounds in poker: preflop, flop, turn, and river (the last round). In addition, there is an ante bet that is made before any cards are turned over - this starts each new hand with some money already in play. Here are some basic tips for betting in poker:

- Bet big when you have a good hand; bet small when you don't have much confidence in your hand. This will help you win more money when you have a strong hand, while also minimising your losses when you're holding bad cards.

- Don't be afraid to fold weak hands - it's better to take a small loss than risk losing more money with a poor hand. Remember: patience pays off in poker!

#  Tips for Playing Blackjack and Poker in France

The first thing to know if you want to gamble in France is that Casino gambling is technically illegal, with a few exceptions. There are however a number of ways to get around this. The most popular bets in France are on horseracing and football (soccer). You can also find plenty of poker and blackjack tables in the country’s many casinos.

Here are some tips for playing casino games in France:

-Unlike in the US, blackjack rules in France vary from casino to casino. Make sure you know the house rules before you start playing. Most French casinos allow players to double down on any two cards, split pairs, and surrender, but there may be some variations.

-Poker is very popular in France and there are many tournaments available. If you’re not familiar with the game, make sure to do your research before playing. There are many different variations of poker, so it’s important to know the basics of each type before playing for real money.

-Casinos in France usually use decks of French playing cards which have 36 cards instead of 52. The four suits are hearts, diamonds, spades, and clubs (no jokers). This can throw American players off at first, so make sure you’re aware of the differences before you start playing.

-Most French casinos allow smoking inside, so if you’re not a smoker it might be best to avoid them.
