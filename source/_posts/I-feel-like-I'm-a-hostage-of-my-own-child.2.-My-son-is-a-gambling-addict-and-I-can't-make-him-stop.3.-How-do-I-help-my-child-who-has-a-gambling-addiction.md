# 5. My daughter is a gambling addict and I'm scared for her future.

Three years ago, my daughter came to me and tearfully confessed that she had a gambling addiction. She had been trying to keep it a secret from me for months, and was terrified that I would be mad at her.

At first, I didn't know how to react. My mind was racing with questions. How could my daughter be a gambling addict? Where did she get money to gamble with? What if she loses everything?

I did a lot of research on gambling addiction and talked to other parents whose children have gone through the same thing. I quickly learned that there is no one "right" way to deal with a gambling addiction. Some parents chose to completely cut off all communication with their child who is addicted to gambling, while others provided support in whatever way they could.

I ultimately decided to provide as much support as possible for my daughter. I wanted her to know that I loved her and believed in her, no matter what mistakes she had made. I also made it clear that I would not tolerate any lying or secrecy on her part anymore.

Thankfully, my daughter is now two years sober from gambling and is doing much better. She's back in school and is working towards getting her degree. She knows that she still has a long road ahead of her, but she's determined to beat her addiction.

If your child is struggling with a gambling addiction, here are some things you can do to help them:

1. Acknowledge that they have a problem and offer your support.
2. Educate yourself about gambling addiction and what resources are available for help. 
3. Communicate openly with your child and express your love and support for them. 
4. Create boundaries for your child and make sure they understand the consequences of their actions. 
5. Seek professional help if necessary
