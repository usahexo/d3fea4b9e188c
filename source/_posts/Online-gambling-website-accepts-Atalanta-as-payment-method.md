#  Atalanta: the new payment method for online gambling

The gambling industry is one of the most profitable on the internet, with illegal transactions estimated at $32.9 billion in 2015. This is a huge market that is only going to grow in the coming years, as online gambling becomes more and more popular. However, one of the main problems with this industry is the fact that it is very difficult to make payments quickly and securely. This is where Atalanta comes in.

Atalanta is a new payment method that has been developed specifically for online gambling transactions. It is based on the blockchain technology and it allows players to make fast and secure payments without having to worry about their safety. Atalanta uses cutting-edge security features such as biometric authentication and it also allows players to keep track of their spending history.

One of the main benefits of using Atalanta is that it eliminates the need for middlemen such as banks and payment processors. This means that players can avoid paying expensive transaction fees, which can often be a burden for small players. Moreover, Atalanta’s blockchain technology ensures that all transactions are transparent and secure, which helps to build trust between players and casinos.

Atalanta has already been launched in several countries and it has been met with great success. Players from all over the world are now able to use Atalanta to make safe and easy payments for their favourite online games.

#  Online gambling site welcomes Atalanta as payment method

Online gambling site Vera&John has announced that it will now accept deposits in Bitcoin from customers of the Italian football club Atalanta.

The move is part of an effort by the site to increase its customer base in Italy. Vera&John is hoping that the addition of Atalanta as a payment method will make it easier for people in the country to bet on their favourite team.

“We are always looking for ways to make our service more convenient and user-friendly, so adding Atalanta as a payment method was a natural step for us,” said a spokesperson for the site.

Bitcoin is becoming increasingly popular as a payment method for online gambling, thanks to its ease of use and fast transaction times. In addition to Vera&John, several other online betting sites now accept Bitcoin deposits, including 1xBit and mBit Casino.

Atalanta is currently in 11th place in Serie A, but they have been one of the surprise packages of the season so far and are still in contention for a place in European competition next year. Fans of the club will now be able to place their bets using Bitcoin on the team’s remaining fixtures this season.
