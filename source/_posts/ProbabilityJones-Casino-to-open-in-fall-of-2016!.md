The ProbabilityJones Casino is scheduled to open in the fall of 2016. The casino will feature table games, slots and poker tournaments. It will be a $50 million project and will create over 350 jobs.

The casino is being developed by ProbabilityJones LLC, a company that is owned by two brothers, Joe and Jerry Jones. This will be the first casino for the company.

"We are excited to bring a world-class casino to our home state," said Joe Jones. "This will be a great destination for people who want to enjoy amazing gaming options and stellar customer service."

The casino is being built on a 50-acre site in the town of Ottumwa. It will feature a 120,000 square foot gaming floor, a hotel with 300 rooms, and several restaurants. There will also be a 1,500 seat entertainment venue.

"People in Iowa love their casinos and we expect this one to be very popular," said Jerry Jones. "We are committed to providing our customers with an excellent experience."

#  ProbabilityJones Casino set to open in Atlantic City!

Atlantic City, long considered the gambling capital of the East Coast, is set to get a new casino. ProbabilityJones Casino will open its doors in late 2018, promising a world-class experience for gamblers of all stripes.

The casino is being built on the site of the old Trump Taj Mahal, which closed its doors in 2016 after becoming embroiled in bankruptcy proceedings. The new casino will be much larger than its predecessor, with over 100,000 square feet of gaming space. There will be 1100 slot machines and 40 table games on offer.

While there are already several casinos operating in Atlantic City, ProbabilityJones Casino is hoping to set itself apart from the competition with its unique design and innovative gaming options. In addition to standard casino games like blackjack and craps, the casino will also offer a range of unique experiences such as virtual reality roulette and 3D poker.

“We want to create an unforgettable experience for our guests,” said casino spokesperson Amanda Palmer. “Our goal is to provide something for everyone, whether you’re a seasoned pro or just looking to have some fun.”

One of the biggest draws of ProbabilityJones Casino is likely to be its location. Situated on the Boardwalk, guests will be able to enjoy stunning ocean views while they gamble. The casino is also walking distance from some of Atlantic City’s most popular restaurants and nightlife venues.

So if you’re looking for some excitement this winter, make sure to put ProbabilityJones Casino on your list!
