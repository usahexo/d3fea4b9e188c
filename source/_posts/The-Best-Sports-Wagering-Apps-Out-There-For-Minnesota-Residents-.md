#  The Best Sports Wagering Apps Out There For Minnesota Residents 

For residents of Minnesota, the legal sports betting scene might seem a little confusing. This is because there has not been any legislation passed on this topic yet. So, what does that mean for people who want to bet on sports?

Minnesota residents can still bet on sports, but they have to do so illegally. There are a few different ways to go about this. You can either use an unlicensed offshore sportsbook, or you can use one of the many black market betting apps that are currently available. 

The downside to using an unlicensed offshore sportsbook is that there is no guarantee that your money will be safe. These books are not regulated, so they could easily scam you out of your hard-earned cash. The upside, however, is that these books typically offer better odds than the black market betting apps. 

The black market betting apps are growing in popularity because they are much safer than using an unlicensed offshore sportsbook. All of the apps that we recommend are licensed and regulated, which means your money is safe if you choose to use them. The downside to these apps is that they typically don’t offer as good of odds as the unlicensed books. 

So, which app should you choose? That depends on what’s important to you. If safety is your number one priority then we recommend using one of the apps we recommend below. If getting the best odds is more important to you, then you may want to consider using an unlicensed offshore sportsbook instead.
