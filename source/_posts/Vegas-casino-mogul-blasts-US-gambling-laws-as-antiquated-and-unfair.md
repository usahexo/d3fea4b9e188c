#  Vegas casino mogul blasts US gambling laws as antiquated and unfair

Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson has launched a blistering attack on the US gambling laws, accusing them of being antiquated and unfair.

In an opinions piece published in The Wall Street Journal, Adelson lambasted the current system, which he said unfairly benefits Native American tribes and other gaming interests.

"Only insiders with political pull can prosper under the present law," he wrote. "This is not what America is about."

Adelson, who is estimated to be worth $37.9 billion, called on lawmakers to pass legislation that would promote a "free and fair" market for gambling. This would include overturning the federal ban on sports betting, which he said costs the US economy billions of dollars each year.

The comments from one of the most high-profile figures in the gambling industry are likely to add momentum to efforts to reform US gambling laws. They come at a time when many states are moving to legalize various forms of online gambling, including sports betting.

Adelson's company Las Vegas Sands is one of the largest casino operators in the world, with properties in Las Vegas, Macau and Singapore. He has been a major donor to Republican political campaigns in recent years.

#  Nevada casino owner says US gambling laws are driving business overseas

The owner of a prominent Las Vegas casino has said that changing laws in the US are forcing businesses such as his to look for opportunities overseas.

Steve Wynn, who owns Wynn Resort, said that the gambling industry in America was becoming less attractive due to tighter regulations. This, he said, was resulting in casinos moving their business to other countries where the regulatory environment is more favourable.

"The US Steve Wynn is no longer the best place to make money in the gaming industry," he told Reuters. "We have to go where we're wanted and be appreciated."

It's not clear exactly which countries Mr Wynn is eyeing up for new investment, but it's thought that he may be looking at Macau and Japan. In Macau, a special administrative region of China, casino gambling is legal and highly regulated; while Japan is contemplating legalizing casino gambling in order to boost tourism.

The news comes as a blow to the US gambling industry, which is already battling against declining revenue. In Nevada, slot machine revenue fell by 8% last year according to figures from the state gaming control board.

For Mr Wynn, however, it makes good business sense to invest elsewhere. "I can make more money now investing in other places than I can here," he said.

#  Macau casino tycoon hits out at US gambling laws

US gambling laws are "archaic" and should be updated to allow casino tycoons like himself to expand their businesses, according to one of the richest men in the world.

Macau casino mogul Stanley Ho said that the current state of regulations was preventing him from investing in new projects in the US. He told Reuters that he would like to see a change in the law so that he can develop new casinos in the country.

"The laws are really archaic," said Ho. "They don't permit joint ventures between locals and foreigners, so I can't do anything."

Ho's comments come as his company, SJM Holdings, posted a 30 percent fall in annual profit. The company blamed falling revenue from its Las Vegas operations for the poor performance. SJM Holdings currently operates 16 casinos in Macau.

The 82-year-old billionaire has been involved in the casino industry since 1946 and is considered to be one of its pioneers. He has faced increasing competition from rival casino operators in recent years, with Macau's gambling market now saturated.

In an effort to stay ahead of the competition, Ho has been looking to expand into new markets such as Japan and South Korea. However, his attempts have been hampered by US gambling laws which prevent him from working with foreign partners.

Casino tycoons such as Sheldon Adelson and Steve Wynn have also expressed frustration with the restrictions placed on them by US authorities. In 2012, Adelson unsuccessfully attempted to overturn a ban on Las Vegas casinos expanding into other states.

#  Why does the US have such strict gambling laws? 

The United States has always been a very conservative country, especially in regards to gambling laws. The first gambling law in the US was passed in 1802, and it basically outlawed all types of gambling.

Since then, the US has gradually loosened its gambling laws, but they are still much stricter than in other countries. For example, casino gambling is legal in many other countries, but it is not legal in most states in the US.

There are a few reasons why the US has such strict gambling laws. The first reason is that gambling can be addictive and can ruin people's lives. The second reason is that gambling can be used to launder money and support organized crime.

These are two big concerns for the US government, and they are why gambling is still tightly regulated in the country.

#  Las Vegas casino boss slams ridiculous US gambling laws

The boss of a casino in Las Vegas has spoken out against US gambling laws, branding them “ridiculous”.

The owner of the MGM Grand casino, James Murren, says that the current laws are not fit for the 21st century. He argues that they are outdated and do not reflect the realities of the modern world.

Murren is particularly critical of the restrictions on online gambling. He believes that this is an area that needs to be reformed in order to keep up with other countries.

He also raised concerns about the large number of people who are banned from casinos. Murren argued that this does nothing to help combat crime and only serves to punish law-abiding citizens.

In a statement, Murren said: “The laws need to be modernized. They were written 40 or 50 years ago and they don’t reflect the realities of the world today.”

He added: “There are a lot of areas where we can improve our gaming industry here in America and we should be doing that instead of just chasing after Canadian and Mexican players.”
