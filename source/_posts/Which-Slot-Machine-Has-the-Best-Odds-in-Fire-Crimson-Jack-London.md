## RTP (Return To Player)

One of the main factors you should consider when choosing a slot machine is its RTP or Return To Player percentage. This measures how much of your bet will be returned to you over time. The higher the percentage, the better your chances are of winning! Casinos usually publish RTP information for their games on their websites so be sure to do your research before playing.

## Progressive Jackpots

Progressive jackpot slots offer some of the best odds in the casino as they tend to have higher RTP percentages than other games.
