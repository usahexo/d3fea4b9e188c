#  Why Clifford's Suns Stole the Show

Clifford’s Suns stole the show in the 2017 Utah Jazz season. While the team as a whole had a great season, and many players had standout moments, it was the Suns who truly shined.

Alec Burks was one of the main contributors for the Suns. He averaged 17 points per game and shot over 43% from beyond the arc. He was also able to get to the free throw line frequently and shot over 81% from the stripe. His play earned him a four-year, $42 million extension from the Jazz.

Rudy Gobert also played a major role for Clifford’s Suns. He averaged 14 points, 12 rebounds, and 2.6 blocks per game. He was also named to his first All-Star team and finished third in voting for Defensive Player of the Year.

Donovan Mitchell was another key player for Clifford’s Suns. He averaged 20 points, 3 rebounds, and 3 assists per game while shooting 38% from three-point range. He was also named Rookie of the Year and made the All-Rookie Team.

Despite all of their individual success, Clifford’s Suns were unable to make it past the first round of the playoffs. However, they provided plenty of excitement throughout the year and looked poised to make a deep playoff run in future seasons.

#  Another Solid Performance from the LA Clippers

In the NBA, there are teams that always manage to surprise people no matter how well you think you know them. The LA Clippers are one of those teams and after their latest victory against the Golden State Warriors, it’s evident that they aren’t going to go down without a fight.

This season, we’ve seen the Clippers put up some unbelievable displays of basketball. They don’t seem to be phased by who they’re playing against and continue to give their all every night.

This was particularly evident against the Warriors on Saturday night. Down by 14 points in the first half, they came back with a vengeance in the second half and managed to take the lead. The final score was 123-119 in favor of the Clippers which just goes to show how much determination they have this season.

Golden State is no slouch though and they put up a good fight too. Klay Thompson led all scorers with 32 points while Steph Curry added 23 points of his own. However, it wasn’t enough to stop Lou Williams from scoring 36 points on the night.

With this victory, the Clippers improve their record to 28-23 on the season which is currently good for 5th place in the Western Conference standings. If they can keep this up, they definitely have a chance of making it deep into the playoffs this year.
